# kyuubi-parcel and csd make script

This project script must be executed in the bin directory, otherwise an error will occur

After the script is executed, the parcel file and csd file for deployment will be generated in the directory parcel/parcel_out and csd/csd_out

When kyuubi is configured in cdh, the page generates kyuubi-env.sh project without using export and $ in the form of key=values. Please refer to the example in the example directory
